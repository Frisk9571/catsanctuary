        <p>
           I'm Frisk. A 16 year old transfem living in the Eastern United States.
        </p>
        <p>
           I like to tinker with technology alot, and have a bit of a strange attachment to tech that would be considered "retro" (like MP3 players)
        </p>

        <p>
           I don't play any instruments, nor have a willingness to do so.
